                    <p>This game is about escaping from a dark labyrinth. </p>
                    <p>As you approach the exit, the darkness will seem to fade. Follow the path back to the light.</p> 
                    <p>There are many levels to this maze. You might find yourself at the threshold only to be plunged deeper into darkness than before. 
                        Do not lose your determination. Persist in the face of adversity.</p>
                    <p>You can navigate using the arrow keys or WASD in your keyboard or the buttons around the gaming area.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>This game was inspired by my wife's support as I pivoted from a career in Human Resources to Software Development</p>
                    <p>That period of my life was marked by heavy doubts and the way forward did not seem clear to me at all. In essence, it felt like
                        like I was making my way through a dark and difficult labyrinth.
                    </p>
                    <p>Her support and encouragement led me to take the leap and make the career pivot. She was - and is to this day - my guiding light in
                        this dark maze.
                    </p>
                    <p>An initial version of this game was made for her back in 2015. This a recreation of that effort, with some improvements but mostly
                        faithful to the original minimalist style.
